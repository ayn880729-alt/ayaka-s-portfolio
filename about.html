    <h3><a name="skills">Skills</a></h3>
    <p> Over the years, I have built a wide range of skills that combine creativity, 
      problem-solving, and hands-on technical ability. <br>
      My training in graphic design has given me a strong foundation in layout, color theory, and typography. <br>
      In addition, my professional work has made me detail-oriented and client-focused.</p>
   
      <h3><a name="work">Work Experiences</a></h3>
   <p>
      My career journey has been a blend of design, project coordination, and customer service. 
      Below are some highlights of my work experience, including both my past career and my 
      current role as a CSR in the printing industry.
    </p>

    <h4>Customer Service Representative – Jukebox Printing (2025–Present)</h4>
    <p>
      As a CSR, I act as the bridge between clients and production. I assist customers in placing 
      orders for custom print projects, guide them through design specifications, and ensure that 
      files are prepared correctly for printing. My role includes troubleshooting issues, 
      coordinating with the prepress team, and maintaining clear communication to deliver 
      high-quality results. This experience has sharpened both my technical eye and my 
      ability to manage client expectations.
    </p>

    <h4>Project Manager – Inside Sales &amp; Demand Planning (2012–2023)</h4>
    <p>
      Before moving into design, I spent over a decade managing projects in inside sales 
      and demand planning. My responsibilities included forecasting product needs, 
      coordinating with supply chain teams, and ensuring timely delivery of customer orders. 
      These years gave me a solid foundation in problem-solving, workflow optimization, 
      and balancing multiple priorities under pressure.
    </p>

    <h4>Freelance Graphic Design Projects</h4>
    <p>
      Alongside my career, I have worked on freelance projects such as poster designs, 
      branding concepts, and visual presentations. These projects allowed me to put 
      my design education into practice and develop my own creative voice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each of these roles has shaped my approach to design and communication. 
      Whether solving a customer’s urgent print request or presenting a creative poster concept, 
      I approach work with curiosity, precision, and a human touch.
    </p>
